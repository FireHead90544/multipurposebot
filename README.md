# MultiPurpose Bot

What does it do? Check out the ?help command when you run it :)

You can feel free to host the bot, but I've got a [free of charge self-hosted version here][invite] for you!

Remember, if you're hosting the bot yourself, you'll need to make sure you have all the modules imported in [bot.py][bot].
